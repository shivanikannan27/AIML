# 🪨📄✂️ Rock–Paper–Scissors (User vs Computer)

A simple Python implementation of the classic *Rock–Paper–Scissors* game where the user plays against the computer.  
This project demonstrates basic Python concepts such as loops, conditionals, input handling, and random number generation.

## 🧠 How the Game Works

1. The user enters *rock, **paper, or **scissors*  
2. The computer randomly picks one  
3. The winner is decided based on the classic rules:
   - Rock beats Scissors  
   - Scissors beats Paper  
   - Paper beats Rock  
4. The result is displayed instantly  
5. Game continues until the user quits (if implemented)

## ▶️ Run the Game

Make sure you have *Python 3* installed.

### *Run using terminal / command prompt:*
```bash
python rps.py

Example Interaction

Rock, Paper or Scissors?
Your choice: rock
Computer chose: scissors
🎉 You win!
